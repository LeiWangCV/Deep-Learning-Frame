# Deep-Learning-Frame
This is a deep learning framework library that I have written myself, and I am preparing to write three versions.

## version 1
This is a deep learning framework library based on Python and Numpy, designed for beginners to understand how deep learning frameworks run.

## version 2
Using C++to implement underlying data structures similar to numpy, used to replace multidimensional arrays in version 1.

## version 3
Using C++to implement CUDA acceleration operator and improve the GPU acceleration function in version 2.
